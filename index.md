# Science today demands FAIR samples 
The Sampling Nature Research Coordination Network supports the multi-disciplinary use of samples requires consistent approaches to sample documentation, sample identification, sample access policies, and sample citation. 

FAIR samples:
- Ensures transparency and reproducibility of research 
- Enables and advances discovery, access, and reuse of material samples generated and studied in cross-disciplinary basic and applied scientific research.
- Supports the integration of material samples into modern-day digital and data-driven research.
- Makes previously impossible connections between diverse and disparate sample-based observations. 

# Join the Sampling Nature Listserv to be part of the community!
The Sampling Nature Research Coordination Network (RCN) is creating connections across the natural history value chain that samples nature at field sites, labs, repositories, and museums through thematic workshops and virtual events to exploit the potential of an accessible, integrated corpus of material sample data.

## Friday, November 3 at 1pm ET | Small identifiers with big impacts: examples from archaeological fieldwork, Sarah Kansa, Open Context

**Abstract:** The importance of identifiers is difficult to convey to many researchers that lack formal training in databases or data management. While under-appreciated, identifier practices can have big downstream impacts on data re-use. In this webinar, we will discuss common identifier practices in the context of an archaeological field project. Different archaeological artifacts, ecofacts (animal or plant remains associated with past human behavior), architectural features, and stratigraphic deposits are all understood in relation to one another. Such relationships inform the understanding of “context”, which is a core interpretive concept in archaeology. Naming and identifying the locations, objects, and other things involved in these contextual relationships make identifier practices critically important in archaeology.

**Bio:** Sarah Kansa is Executive Director of the Alexandria Archive Institute, a California non-profit organization that develops Open Context, a data publishing service for archaeology and cultural heritage.
