# Workshops
The Sampling Nature Research Coordination Network (RCN) creates connections across the natural history value chain that samples nature at field sites, labs, repositories, and museums through thematic workshops to exploit the potential of an accessible, integrated corpus of material sample data.

## Nature - Biodiversity and Climate Early 2024 - Washington, D.C 

**Abstract:** This workshop is the 4th in the Sampling Nature series and is a collaboration between Sampling Nature, iSamples, and Omic BON to explore how to reuse data and samples to improve biodiversity observations, combine them with other data types, and contribute to global models. Omic observations are tied to material samples, and tracking the metadata and context of those samples is critical to data quality and reuse.
