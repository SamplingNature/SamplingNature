# Sampling Nature Research Coordination Network


[NSF Award](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2129268)


Material samples are the most basic form of data about the natural world. Their collection and study are fundamental for solving sustainability goals. Unfortunately, harnessing existing samples and sample-based data for future science is nearly impossible, because they are often not Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). A vast number of scientific material samples has already and continues to be collected, yet most samples remain unknown and inaccessible to researchers at large. The complex landscape of intellectual, technical, social, legal, and regulatory issues surrounding material and data sharing often results in insurmountable barriers to making them FAIR. Overcoming these barriers demands not only robust transdisciplinary infrastructure, but also community-driven metadata standards and effective data policies, combined with training and outreach to support adoption. The Sampling Nature Research Coordination Network (RCN) will maximize the natural history value chain that samples nature at field sites, labs, repositories, and museums; processes those samples for scientific analyses; and stores the resulting materials and derived data in diverse and distributed databases and repositories.


Through a series of thematic workshops and regular virtual events, Sampling Nature will build a community of collaborative researchers to exploit the potential of an accessible, integrated corpus of material sample data. The RCN will deliver an extensible, domain neutral, community-driven metadata standard, with recommendations for its short- and long-term governance; policy recommendations around the collection, transport, storage, preservation, and sharing of material samples; training materials covering best practices for sample identification and metadata; an innovative social media campaign to communicate the importance of material samples in science, society, and sustainability. Sampling Nature brings together a new and interdisciplinary group of PIs that will engage researchers from multiple NSF directorates, federal agencies, Indigenous groups, museums, publishers, and infrastructure.

Abstract: Archives that provide access to high-quality research data offer an ideal setting to study the community impact of data sharing. In this talk, I will describe the data citation network at ICPSR – a social science data archive at the University of Michigan – which reflects patterns of data reuse in academic literature. I have detected 41 research communities that use the same scientific datasets, which I characterize as disciplinary "subdivisions" or integrative "crossroads" connecting research areas. I show how spatial perspectives on data use offer insights into scholarly communication processes, such as the organization of scientific communities.

Bio: Sara Lafia is a Research Fellow in the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) at the University of Michigan. Her research is supported by an NSF project, Developing Evidence-based Data Sharing and Archiving Policies, in which she analyzes curation activities, trains models to detect informal data citations in academic literature, and develops metrics to track the impact of data curation. She holds a Ph.D. in Geography from UC Santa Barbara.
