# Sampling Nature Research Coordination Network


[NSF Award](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2129268)


Material samples are the most basic form of data about the natural world. Their collection and study are fundamental for solving sustainability goals. Unfortunately, harnessing existing samples and sample-based data for future science is nearly impossible, because they are often not Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). A vast number of scientific material samples has already and continues to be collected, yet most samples remain unknown and inaccessible to researchers at large. The complex landscape of intellectual, technical, social, legal, and regulatory issues surrounding material and data sharing often results in insurmountable barriers to making them FAIR. Overcoming these barriers demands not only robust transdisciplinary infrastructure, but also community-driven metadata standards and effective data policies, combined with training and outreach to support adoption. The Sampling Nature Research Coordination Network (RCN) will maximize the natural history value chain that samples nature at field sites, labs, repositories, and museums; processes those samples for scientific analyses; and stores the resulting materials and derived data in diverse and distributed databases and repositories.


Through a series of thematic workshops and regular virtual events, Sampling Nature will build a community of collaborative researchers to exploit the potential of an accessible, integrated corpus of material sample data. The RCN will deliver an extensible, domain neutral, community-driven metadata standard, with recommendations for its short- and long-term governance; policy recommendations around the collection, transport, storage, preservation, and sharing of material samples; training materials covering best practices for sample identification and metadata; an innovative social media campaign to communicate the importance of material samples in science, society, and sustainability. Sampling Nature brings together a new and interdisciplinary group of PIs that will engage researchers from multiple NSF directorates, federal agencies, Indigenous groups, museums, publishers, and infrastructure.

### Friday, September 8 at 1pm ET | Connecting samples to the research ecosystem through documentation and discovery tools, Lindsay Powers, USGS

Abstract: Physical samples are often expensive and irreplaceable assets foundational to understanding the universe and its processes, and they should be preserved and made available for ongoing or new research. For these assets to be useful in this capacity, they must have descriptive documentation and be readily discoverable to interdisciplinary users. Persistent unique identifiers (PIDs) for people, organizations, data, publications, scientific collections, and samples, greatly facilitate the discovery of relevant physical samples for new research by connecting samples to all elements of the research ecosystem. 

The U.S. Geological Survey has improved tools to better document scientific collections and samples and connect research assets through persistent unique identifiers. Among these, the mdEditor is a metadata creation and editing tool developed collaboratively with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service to broadly facilitate rich metadata description for multiple domain data, sample, and collection types.  The mdEditor has been adapted to create descriptions for physical scientific collections, which are cataloged in the Registry of Scientific Collections (ReSciColl). In addition, we are developing the AIS (Asset Identification Service) to manage and provision persistent unique identifiers; DOIs for data, publications, and scientific collections; International Generic Sample Numbers (IGSN) for physical samples; PIDs for metadata records and others as needed. ReSciColl provides the opportunity to include PIDs for people (ORCID), organizations (ROR), collections data and publications (DOI), and physical samples (IGSN). Consistent use of PIDs in our enterprise systems, provides an explicit mechanism for asset interoperability and assures that these valuable resources can be discovered and assessed for relevance for new discovery.

Bio: Lindsay is trained as a multidisciplinary scientist with an education and research experience in aquatic ecology, population genetics, limnology, and paleoclimatology. Lindsay completed her B.A at Macalester College, her M.S. at University of Montana, and her Ph.D. at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.  Her current work at the U.S. Geological Survey is primarily concerned with preserving, modernizing, and facilitating access to scientific collections of physical samples. Lindsay is the Program Coordinator for the National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program and Director of the USGS Geological Materials Repository, home to the Core Research Center and the National Science Foundation Ice Core Facility.


### Friday, July 7 at 1pm ET | Subdivisions and Crossroads: Identifying Communities in Data Citation Networks, Sara Lafia 
* [Recording](https://youtu.be/1B3A6n03VG8)
Abstract: Archives that provide access to high-quality research data offer an ideal setting to study the community impact of data sharing. In this talk, I will describe an analysis of the data citation network available through ICPSR – a social science data archive at the University of Michigan – which reflects patterns of data reuse in academic literature in research communities that use the same scientific datasets. These communities are characterized as disciplinary "subdivisions" or integrative "crossroads" that connect research areas. I show how data citation allows us to understand scholarly communication processes, such as the organization of scientific communities, and will discuss implications for the citation of samples.

Bio: Sara Lafia is a Research Fellow in the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) at the University of Michigan. Her research is supported by an NSF project, Developing Evidence-based Data Sharing and Archiving Policies, in which she analyzes curation activities, trains models to detect informal data citations in academic literature, and develops metrics to track the impact of data curation. She holds a Ph.D. in Geography from UC Santa Barbara.
